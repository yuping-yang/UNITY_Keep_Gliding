Game Description:

In "Keep Gliding," your goal is to keep your plane soaring through the sky for as long as possible. The gameplay is simple yet challenging: use the spacebar to control the altitude of your plane. Hold the spacebar to make the plane ascend, and release it to let the plane descend.

As you glide through the sky, obstacles will appear in your path. Navigate your plane carefully to avoid these obstacles, as crashing into them will end your flight. For every obstacle you successfully pass, you’ll earn 1 point, which is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.

How long can you keep gliding? Test your skills and aim for the highest score!
